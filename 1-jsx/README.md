# JSX Project

This project is a simple React application demonstrating the use of JSX.

## Project Structure

The main files of this project are index.js and App.js.

### `index.js`

This file is responsible for rendering the main App component to the root element in *index.html*. Here's a brief overview of what the code in index.js does:

Import the `React` and `ReactDOM` libraries: The React library is used for creating React components and the ReactDOM library is used for rendering those components to the DOM. The `App` component is also imported from the App.js file.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
```

Get a reference to the root element in index.html: The document.getElementById("root") function is used to get a reference to the root element in the index.html file. This is where our React application will be mounted.

```javascript
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
```

Tell react to take control of that element: The `ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)` function is used to create a root React container at the rootElement DOM node and return a Root object. The Root object is the foundation of a React tree. Updates and reconciliations are scheduled on it.

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
```

Show the component on the screen: The `root.render(<App />)` function is used to render the App component to the root element in the index.html file. This is where the React application actually becomes visible to the user.

### `App.js`

This file exports the App component, which is the main component of the application.

```javascript
function App() {
  return <h1>Hi there!</h1>;
}
export default App;
```

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
2. Start the application by running `npm start` in the terminal.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:

* `React`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* `ReactDOM`: A library that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.
